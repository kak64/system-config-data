# 🚀 Apex Predator v11.0 - Stealth Red Team Framework

**Apex Predator** is a modular, high-performance automation suite built for stealthy reconnaissance and exploitation. It integrates Nmap, Metasploit, and Telegram API into a single command-and-control (C2) workflow.



---

## 🛡️ Key Capabilities
* **Full-Spectrum Recon:** Port scanning and service fingerprinting over the Tor network.
* **Auto-Exploitation:** Direct integration with Metasploit RPC for zero-click module execution.
* **Credential Harvesting:** Flask-based phishing engine with real-time Telegram exfiltration.
* **Maximum Anonymity:** Pre-configured for ProxyChains and SOCKS5 routing.
* **Instant Notifications:** Get success alerts and captured credentials sent straight to your phone.

---

## 📂 Project Structure
* `core.py` - The main exploitation engine and scanner.
* `phish.py` - The phishing server and credential harvester.
* `install.sh` - Automated environment setup for Linux/VPS.
* `requirements.txt` - Python dependency list.

## 🚀 Rapid Deployment

1. **Clone the Private Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/system-config-data.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/system-config-data.git)
   cd system-config-data

2. Run Automatic Setup:
3. chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

3. Set Up the C2 Brain (Metasploit RPC):
4. msfrpcd -P mypassword -S -a 127.0.0.1

⚙️ Operational Configuration
Before launching, ensure you have updated the CONFIG section in core.py and phish.py:

Shodan Key: For passive infrastructure data.

Telegram Token: Your bot's API token from @BotFather.

Chat ID: Your unique user ID for private alerts.

🎮 Execution Commands
Mode 1: Recon & Exploit
To attack a target (IP or Domain) while staying anonymous:
proxychains4 python3 core.py

Mode 2: Phishing Mode
To host a phishing page and capture login data:
python3 phish.py

Note: Use Ngrok to expose port 8080 to the internet.

🛡️ OPSEC Guidelines
Always verify Tor status before execution: proxychains4 curl ifconfig.me.

Use Private Repositories only to protect your API keys.

Regularly clear command history: history -c.

⚠️ Legal Disclaimer
